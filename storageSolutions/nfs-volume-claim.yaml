# This manifest 'claims' the persistent volume for our pod,
# isolating our Pod definition from our storage definition.

# You can declare volumes directly inside a Pod specification, but
# this locks that Pod specification to a particular volume provider.

# By using volume claims, you can keep your Pod specifications cloud
# -agnostic; simply create different volumes, specific to the cloud,
# and use a PersistentVolumeClaim to bind them together.

# Now that weâ€™ve claimed our volume, we can use a
# ReplicaSet to construct our singleton Pod.
